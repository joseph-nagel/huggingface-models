# Hugging Face models

This repository is just a playground for models provided by Hugging Face.
It is largely based on the tutorials and examples in the official documentation.
The [timm](https://huggingface.co/docs/timm/index) (PyTorch image models) and the [transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) library provide large number of pretrained models.
Both of them implement convenient APIs for model loading, training, fine-tuning and inferencing.
